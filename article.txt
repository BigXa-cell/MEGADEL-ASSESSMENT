Responsive design is essential in modern web development because it ensures that websites look and function well on any device, from desktops to smartphones. With the increasing variety of screen sizes and devices used to access the web, it's important to provide an optimized experience for all users. Without responsive design, a website might look great on a desktop but be hard to navigate on a phone or tablet, which could lead to a poor user experience and lost traffic.

A real-world example of a website that benefits from responsive design is Amazon. Whether you're browsing on a large desktop monitor or shopping on your phone, Amazon's layout adjusts to fit the screen size, making it easy to browse products, view images, and complete purchases, no matter the device. This flexibility helps ensure that users stay engaged and can shop seamlessly across devices.

Key CSS techniques for building responsive websites include flexbox and media queries. Flexbox allows developers to create flexible layouts that adjust to different screen sizes, making it easier to align elements in rows or columns without worrying about rigid positioning. Media queries are used to apply different styles depending on the deviceâ€™s screen size, orientation, or resolution. For example, you can use media queries to change the layout or font size on smaller screens, ensuring readability and a clean design on mobile devices. Together, these techniques allow for smooth and efficient responsive web design.
