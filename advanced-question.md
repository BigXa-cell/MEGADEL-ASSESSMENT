### **5️⃣ Advanced Frontend Question** 

11. **In React, what happens during the reconciliation process, and how does the virtual DOM improve performance?**

In React, the reconciliation process is how the framework efficiently updates the DOM when the state or props of a component change. React creates a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM, and compares it with the previous version of the Virtual DOM using a diffing algorithm. This allows React to figure out the minimal number of changes needed to update the real DOM. Instead of re-rendering the entire UI, React only updates the parts of the DOM that have changed, improving performance. This is faster because direct DOM manipulation is costly, and the Virtual DOM allows React to make updates in memory before applying them to the actual DOM, making the process much more efficient, especially for larger applications.

e,g

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Increment the count when the button is clicked
  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
